This is my first portfolio website built using Vite and React technologies. I used TailwindCSS for styling and included some packages such as Hero Icons, React Icons, Aceternity,  React Scroll and Framer Motion.

Description

This website created by best new technology like:

-React.js

-Tailwindcss

and awesome packages like:

-React Icons

-Netlify

-Framer Motion

Features

Responsive design
Minimalistic UI with a clean and modern look
Smooth animations using Framer Motion components  to give an
Interactive scroll experience

# Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
