            I have been coding for 5 years, after an injury left me with physical limitations in 2021. I realised it was a creative feild mixed with problem-solving and it was ever-evolving! I decided to enroll in <span className="text-blue-100 tracking-wider font-semibold underline"><a href="https://www.shecodes.io/graduates/126818-nichole-alonso" >SheCodes Frontend development</a></span> program to get a proper foundation and dedicate 100% of my time<span className="text-blue-100  text-3xl ps-1">.</span>

          With over a decade of diverse experience, I have developed a strong foundation in business management, customer service, operations, and team leadership. My career began in the fitness industry, where I served as a personal trainer and later founded and operated my own fitness studio for 10 years. In this role, I honed my skills in social media marketing, event planning, and collaboration with local businesses, while overseeing all aspects of business operations, including budgeting, invoicing, inventory management, promotional campaigns, and customer service<span className="text-blue-100  text-3xl ps-1">.</span>

          Transitioning to the role of Warehouse Parts Manager, I brought my management expertise to a new industry, where I was responsible for inventory control, cost management, and overseeing field technicians. My duties included maintaining stock levels, managing technician schedules, handling repairs and truck maintenance, and ensuring smooth communication between our office, factory, dealers, and customers. I also trained new employees, handled customer service and complaint resolution, and maintained service equipment for remote workers<span className="text-blue-100  text-3xl ps-1">.</span>

          <p className="text-white-100 lg:text-[18px] md:text-md font-normal mb-5">
          Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated a strong ability to adapt, lead teams, and drive efficiency and profitability in fast-paced environments<span className="text-blue-100">.</span>

           I transitioned into the technology field because my previous experiencesâ€”spanning health and wellness, parts management, and appliance field technician roles revealed a common thread: they all lacked the power of better technology to truly make an impact. In each of those roles, I found myself seeking more creativity, more problem-solving, and more ways to help people. Web developement became the natural next step for me, where I could merge my diverse background with my passion for innovation and real-world problem solving. It&apos;s not just about technology for me; it&apos;s about using it to create solutions that make a tangible difference in people&apos;s lives.
